# fuel-economy

API to get vehicle fuel economy from the U.S. E.P.A database off the official U.S. Government website at <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml" target="_blank" />fueleconomy.gov</a>.

#

We scrape data from the site instead of using the API since test results have shown that the web API provides different 
and less data than navigating the site as a user.

Here is information on the <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml">API provided by fueleconomy.gov</a> if your interested.

## Usage

This PHP REST API provides has a single method: 'get_fueleco'

## Installation
